# β-VAE implemented in Pytorch

In this repo, I have implemented two VAE:s insipered by the β-VAE [[1]](#1). One has a Fully Conected Encoder/decoder architecture and the other CNN. The networks have been trained on the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset.

### TODO
- [ ] Hyper Parameter search for the CNN-version.
- [ ] Documentation

## Fully connected encoder/decoder network


## CNN encoder/Decoder network
